### **No Hook AntiHP v1.0.0 - Penalty-Free Gameplay**

**No Hook AntiHP** is a simple yet powerful mod for ULTRAKILL, designed to offer a more relaxed and penalty-free gameplay experience. By eliminating the effects of AntiHP, it lets players focus on movement, combat, and exploration without the worry of style penalties tied to mechanics like the HookArm.

## üöß How It Works

The mod dynamically interacts with ULTRAKILL's core systems:
- **HookArm Monitoring**: Constantly tracks the HookArm's usage to prevent AntiHP from being applied.
- **Global AntiHP Reset**: Monitors the player's AntiHP value and resets it to zero whenever an increase is attempted.
- **Seamless Integration**: Built with BepInEx, the mod modifies systems like `NewMovement` and `HookArm` to ensure compatibility and smooth performance.
